# Cricket-Data-Analytics-Project-

This project is a cricket data analytics project that uses web scraping, Python, Pandas, and Power BI to analyze the T20 World Cup 2022 data. The goal of the project is to select the best 11 players from the T20 World Cup 2022 data. 

 

The project is divided into three parts: 

# Data Processing:
In this part, I use Python and Pandas to process the web scraped data from the T20 cricket World Cup 2022. I have done creating dataframes, cleaning and transforming the data, and exporting the CSV files for Power BI visualization. 

# Dashboard Creation: 
In this part, I use Power BI to create a dashboard for a cricket data analytics project. I have created DAX measures, calculated columns, and various visuals to display the data. I have also applied filters and criteria to select the best players for different roles and positions. 

# Conclusion:
In this part, I have selected the final 11 players for a cricket team based on data analysis using Python, Pandas, and Power BI. I have choosen the best players for each position, based on the criteria of batting and bowling performance, and the visualizations of the team statistics.
